# Sample Node project structure

There is no recommended project structure at all for node.js projects. It varies extremely based on the project. However, this repo contains a basic folder structure which could be modified/refactored as the project progresses.

There are definitely many things you can do better or in a more efficient way, but we'll start with this one.

## Structure used
We have the following structure currently.

```
|--src
|  |-config 
|  |-constants
|  |-controllers
|  |-middlewares
|  |-routes
|  |-utils
|  |-models
|
